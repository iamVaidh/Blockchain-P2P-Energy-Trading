# Blockchain-P2P-Energy-Trading âš¡

The incentive mechanism in the P2P contract is designed to encourage prosumers to participate in the energy trading market. It works by rewarding prosumers with a small percentage of the purchase price for each unit of energy they buy, and a larger percentage of the sale price for each unit of energy they sell. The rewards are calculated using a formula that takes into account the following factors:

- The price of energy.
- The amount of energy traded.
 
The smart contract stores all of the data related to energy trading, including the price of energy, the amount of energy traded. The smart contract also calculates the rewards for each prosumer and distributes the rewards to the prosumers' wallets.

The incentive mechanism is designed to be fair and equitable to all participants in the energy trading market. It is also designed to be sustainable, so that the market can continue to operate in the long term. The incentive mechanism is used to encourage people to buy and sell energy from each other. The mechanism works by rewarding people who buy and sell energy with a small amount of ethers. This reward is called a "subsidy". The subsidy is paid out to the buyer and seller of the energy in proportion to the amount of energy they trade. The incentive mechanism is designed to make it more attractive for people to buy and sell energy from each other. This is because the subsidy provides an additional benefit to buying and selling energy, which can help to increase the volume of energy trading.

**In simple terms, the main moto of incentive mechanism is to encourage (maximum) user engagement.**
